# FileHandler_With_GUI - Notes

**Description:**

Notes is a graphical user interface (GUI) application built with Tkinter for managing and handling files. The project is named **'Notes'** because the idea originated from jotting down ideas on a sticky note.

**Current Status:**

Please note (no pun intended) that this project is currently under development. While the core features are functional, there are still ongoing improvements and updates.
In the future I plan to add additional features for user experience, different colours, light and dark modes etc. I also plan on changing the GUI from Tkinter to PyQt5 but maybe I create a seperate repository for that.

Contributions, feedback, and suggestions are as always welcome as the project evolves.

**Features:**

- Intuitive GUI for file management
- Basic file operations such as open, save, and edit
- Customizable settings and options

**Installation:**

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash

    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd FileHandler_With_GUI
    ```
3. Set up the virtual environment and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

**Usage:**
